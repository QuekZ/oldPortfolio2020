Rather than a pixel by pixel reproduction, I did this one freehand.  As a result, it's less jagged.  The original is a solid version of Pioneer, a shadow font; this version also has only one descender (on the Q).  Only characters available in Print Shop have been produced.


You can find some of my other work on Dafont or Fontstruct.  I'm also on Twitter @omegaville.
