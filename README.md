# oldPortfolio2020
This Website was made by me for my Portfolio in 2020.

I wanted to make something unique and thats why i tried out the Three.js Library to learn something about 3D rendering in the Browser. For this little Project i made an interactive cube that is following the mouse and has its own animations. Through the Shaders it looks Glitched and distorted.

# For this Website i used the following Technologies: 
* HTML, CSS, Javscript 
* Bootstrap
* Three.js and some of its Shaders that are modified

# Here is a Screenshot of the Start Page:
