# oldPortfolio2020
I made this Website as my Portfolio in 2020

For this Website i used Basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
To make it more interactive and special I used the Three.js Library to render some 3D in the background.
To add a "Glitch Look" i used some example Shaders and modified them a bit. It creates a distortion and moves the Color channels a bit around.
